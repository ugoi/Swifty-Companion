# Mobile Initiation Swifty Companion

## Summary
This project aims to introduce you to mobile application development using the 42 API to retrieve information of 42 students.

## Introduction
In this project, you will develop a mobile application that retrieves information of 42 students using the 42 API. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.

## Goals
This project aims to familiarize you with:
- Mobile programming languages (Flutter, Swift, Kotlin, Java, etc.).
- Any IDE of your choice (e.g., Android Studio).
- Mobile Frameworks.
- 42 API.

## General Instructions
- This project will be evaluated by humans.
- You can use any mobile language.
- Use the latest version of the IDE available on your school computers.
- Justify the use of any frameworks and libraries during your defense.
- Use the latest version of the 42 API.
- Save credentials, API keys, etc., locally in a .env file and ignore them in git.

## The Project

### Mandatory Part
To validate the mandatory part of the project, you need to meet the following criteria:
- Your app must have at least 2 views.
- Handle all error cases (login not found, network error, etc.).

*Note: The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is perfect.*

## Submission and Peer-Evaluation
Turn in your assignment in your Git repository. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Double-check the names of your folders and files to ensure correctness.
